VERSIONS

- ROROsim : first version of the simulator parametrized for RORO final rocket or Tethys

- ERTsim : first version of the simulator parametrized for ERT final rocket

- ERTsimwithcontroller : simulator modified to have a simulated ideal controller (modification of drag coefficient)
                         contains matlab code to fill the lookup table

- ERTsimwithcontroller2.0 : updated simulator with controller

- ERTsim3.0 : updated simulator without controller 



TODO: 
- add the controller on the final version of the simulator
- make the controller not ideal (time to change Drag Coef corresponding to opening time of airbrakes mechanism)
